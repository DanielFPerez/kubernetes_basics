# Basic Cluster

This example is created using the tutorial from [TechWorld with Nana: Kubernetes Crash Course](https://youtu.be/s_o8dwzRlu4?t=2479).

This tutorial makes a web-app and a MongoDB Database, making use of ConfigMaps and Secret.
Finally, it makes the application accessible from the outside by offering it as a service.
